Miles Halter has no idea what’s in store for him when he transfers to his father’s old prep school. He certainly doesn’t anticipate rooming with a short, stocky boy nicknamed "The Colonel" who memorizes the capital and populations of all the countries in the world. He definitely doesn’t predict Takumi, the rapper with the fox hat, or Lara, the quiet Russian girl who is his first date. And he never anticipates a girl like Alaska Young coming into his life and changing it forever.Overall, the characters of John Green’s novel, Looking for Alaska, are multi-faceted and diverse. They indulge in witty dialogue that will entertain readers when paired with Miles' internal musings. Intertwining the teenage years with maturation, the novel is more YA-aimed, but any adult can enjoy the book. Peppered with relevant teen themes, such as drinking and pranks, LFA is direct and edgy. The novel's events are arranged in a "countdown" manner, which helps progression of the novel reach a chilling magnitude- and the ensuing effect is the heightening of the reader's tension and excitement. LFA will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotion as you learn to live and love with Miles, The Colonel, Takumi, Lara, and Alaska Young.
